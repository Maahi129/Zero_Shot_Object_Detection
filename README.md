# Zero_Shot_Object_Detection
## What is Zero Shot Classification ?
### Zero-shot object detection is a computer vision task where a model identifies and localizes objects within an image while being able to classify objects into classes it has never seen during training, relying on textual or attribute-based class descriptions and semantic embeddings. This novel approach combines the challenges of object localization and zero-shot classification, making it a complex yet promising area of research within the field of computer vision.
